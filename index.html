	<div id="textBody">  
    <p>Hi everyone, I am a Senior Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.mediadesignschool.com/courses/game-art-development">Games Department</a> at <a href="https://www.mediadesignschool.com">Media Design School</a>. 
</p>
<p>My role entails curriculum development, development of learning and assessment strategies, active teaching, mentoring, and research. I see gameplay programming as art, also believe in the power of games for change. My area of interest include games for impact and social change, games for health and well-being, UX and human factors, system design, and HCI. I love Sci-Fi and fantasy-fiction, and am an Ursula Le Guin and Neil Gaiman fan.
</p>
    <p>Before starting a teaching career at Media Design School in 2012, I worked as a software engineer in the defence industry.</p>
	
	<p>I use my first surname, Tece (TC), among my colleagues and students, otherwise shortly Aslı.
